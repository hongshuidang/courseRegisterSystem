# courseRegisterSystem
It is a web system built by ASP.NET MVC scaffolds and SQL Server and It has been deployed onto Azure cloud: https://s2g1sis.azurewebsites.net 
"S2G1_SISDB.bak" is the DB file and "Build and deploy SIS by VS MVC scaffold_Github_Azure" is a configuration file that records all the detailed steps of building an ASP.NET MVC Web app via controller scraffold, sharing source code from VS to Github, and deploying the app and DB to Microsoft cloud Azure. And it contains some troubles and their solution I got throughout the whole process.
